# Projects-Based-on-R-Code
Each presentation or document was developed from a R coding assignment that was given in the Data Analytics for Data Science Certification Program ran by the University of Texas at Austin.
Once the data provided for each one was uploaded into RStudio, multiple machine learning models were developed and evaluated to determine which one best met each assignment's goals.
